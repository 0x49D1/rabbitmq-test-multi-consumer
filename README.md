### rabbitmq-test-multi-consumer
# THIS IS JUST A SAMPLE!
*Sample* to check RabbitMQ with exchange (to send messages to multiple queues) and multiple consumers in one of the queues, to process the queue faster.    
The project assumes that you have RabbitMQ server running on localhost (docker for example: https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq). Queues are durable.    
Samples were taken from official [RabbitMQ .NET tutorials](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-dotnet.html).
